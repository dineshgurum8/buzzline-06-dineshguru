# Environment settings file (.env)

# Purpose
#  This file is used to define environment-specific variables for the application.
#  Keeping configuration information out of code files enhances security and flexibility.
#  Default values can be provided in the code if this file cannot be read.

# How to Use
#  1. Install the external package 'dotenv' into your virtual environment.
#  2. Import the 'load_dotenv' function into your Python file.
#  3. Call the 'load_dotenv()' function at the start of your application.

# Python Example
#  from dotenv import load_dotenv
#  load_dotenv()

# Maintain two versions of this file
#   1. .env.example
#      A template containing all necessary 
#      environment variables WITHOUT sensitive information.
#      Commit this file to version control as record of variable names.
#   2. .env
#      A file containing actual environment-specific configurations, 
#      including sensitive data and secrets.
#      Do NOT commit this file to version control. 
#      Ensure there is an entry for .env in .gitignore to prevent
#      accidental exposure of sensitive information.

# UPPER_CASE with UNDERSCORES 
# - Follow naming convention for environment variables.
# - No spaces or special characters allowed.
# - Use descriptive, uppercase names to indicate purpose.
# - Add units to numeric variable names (e.g., INTERVAL_SECONDS).
